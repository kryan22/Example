# Standard Error of Measurement

This [GitHub](https://www.github.com) repository (called a *repo*) contains a simple single-page markdown template (`index.md`) that will be
used to create a single web-page assessment literacy module.

Creating your own assessment literacy module using this format is easy.

## Fork the Repo

1. Fork this repo by clicking on the **Fork** button in the upper right of this page. Create or log in to your GitHub account if prompted to.
2. On your forked version of the page, click on the **Settings** tab located toward the top of the page.
3. If you'd like, change the **Repository name** from **Literasee_Setup**. If you do, click **Rename** and then go back to the **Settings** tab.
4. Scroll down to the section **GitHub Pages**, click on the **Source** dropdown,  select **maaster branch**, and click **Save**. You now have a webpage.
5. Go back to your main repo page (scroll up to the top and click on the repo name in the header).
6. Change the *URL* in the top description portion of the page to `https://YOUR_USER_NAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/` by clicking the **Edit** button. This will make it easier for you/other people to get to your page.


## Add in your Content

1. The `index.md` file contains the text (formatted with Markdown) that comprises your module.
2. There are several ways to edit `index.md`:
    * GitHub allows for markdown editing directly from its site. Click on `index.md` and then click on the *pencil* icon in the upper right. You can now edit and preview the markdown in `index.md`
    * There are several online markdown editors that integrate with GitHub. [Dillinger](dillinger.io) and [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) are two.
3. At any time, you can save your changes by scrolling to the bottom and clicking **Commit changes**. You can also add notes indicating what the changes are that you've made.


## Tidy things up

1. Change the `README.md` to reflect the contents of your assessment literacy module.


## Under the hood

1. GitHub is providing us with a site to host our source code as well as a server to serve the content!
2. Details on how this works can be found [here](https://github.com/blog/2289-publishing-with-github-pages-now-as-easy-as-1-2-3).
